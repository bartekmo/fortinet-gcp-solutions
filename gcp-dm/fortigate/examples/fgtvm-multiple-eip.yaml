# This example Deployment Manager configuration file demonstraces deployment
# of a Fortigate with multiple external IP addresses.
# It will create two VPC networks with subnets and deploy a Fortigate with
# two IP addresses attached using protocol forwarding.

# externalIP property in the first network is optional, but omitting it requires
# internal connectivity for management.

# additionalExternalIPs can be used for forwarding connections to additional
# services. IP pools and address objects are auto-created by template, but
# VIPs and firewall rules have to be configured after deployment manually.
